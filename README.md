# Alien Eggs - Spaghetti Studio Game Jam Submission

Welcome to **Alien Eggs**, our submission for the **Spaghetti Studio Game Jam**! 🎮🐣 

## 🏆 Game Jam Theme
This first version of the game comes right at the end of the **Spaghetti Studio Game Jam**, where the theme was:  
**"Better an egg today than a chicken tomorrow."**

## 🛸 Game Concept
In **Egg Escape**, you are trapped on a spaceship, isolated and vulnerable, with a dangerous alien creature on board.
The creature has laid numerous eggs across the ship, and your mission is to **destroy them all** before the alien mother catches you.
Time is running out, and survival depends on your wits and tools.

## 🎨 Game Design
For the design, we chose a **simplistic UI** that covers the entire screen. This minimalist approach emphasizes the claustrophobic
tension of the spaceship environment, immersing you in the high-stakes mission.
The sounds will play a major role in the orientation and advise us if the MOTHER is near...
Here's how it works:

- 🗺️ **Radar**: Your main navigation tool. The radar helps you locate the eggs and detect the alien mother's proximity.  
- 🔋 **Battery**: Provides hope and a chance to illuminate walls for a brief moment, revealing the immediate surroundings.  
- 💻 **Terminal Console**: A simple console offering vital information. It keeps track of how many eggs remain and provides
		crucial updates during your mission.

Everything is designed to keep you focused, on edge, and constantly aware of the threats lurking in the shadows.

---

This is just the beginning of **Alien Eggs**, and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.
Good luck, and remember: **better an egg today than a chicken tomorrow**!
